# Go Practice Repository  

Welcome to my **Go Practice Repository**! ðŸš€  

## About  
This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning the **Go programming language (Golang)**.  
I'll be uploading my daily practice code, exercises, and small projects as I progress through the fundamentals and advanced concepts of Go.  

## Goals  
1. Understand the core concepts of Go, including syntax, data structures, and concurrency.  
2. Build hands-on experience by solving coding problems and developing small projects.  
3. Document the learning process for future reference and to help others who might be learning Go.  

## Structure  
- Each day's practice will be organized into folders named `Day-<number>` (e.g., `Day-1`, `Day-2`, etc.).  
- Each folder will contain code files, notes, and any relevant resources for that day's learning.
